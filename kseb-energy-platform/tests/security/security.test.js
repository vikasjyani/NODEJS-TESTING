// Placeholder for Security Tests
// Security testing is a broad area and often involves a mix of automated scanning tools,
// manual penetration testing, and specific tests for known vulnerability types.
// This file can serve as a placeholder for Jest-based tests that check specific,
// automatable security aspects or integrate with security scanning tools/linters.
